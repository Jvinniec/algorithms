# General Algorithms
This repository is where I keep examples of various algorithms that I've implemented in various languages. It is a convenient place to start when attempting to learn a new programming language.

* Data structures
  * [Heap](data_structures/heap_datastruct/) (binary)
  * [Tree](data_structures/tree_datastruct/) (binary)
* Algorithms
  * **sorting**: Various sorting algorithms
    * [bubble sort](algorithms/sort/bubble_sort/)
    * [heap sort](algorithms/sort/heap_sort/)
    * [insertion sort](algorithms/sort/insertion_sort/)
    * [merge sort](algorithms/sort/merge_sort/)
    * [selection sort](algorithms/sort/seelction_sort/)
    * [quick sort](algorithms/sort/quick_sort/)
  * [pi](algorithms/pi/): Computing $\pi$ from random numbers.

## A note on programming methodology
In order for readability and ease of processing the following rules for each method are used:
* Only one return statement in each method (at the end)
